## Confuse 'bad product' with 'bad AI'
At the other end of the spectrum, many teams dismiss gen AI as a valid solution for their problems because they tried it out and their users hated it. However, other teams successfully used gen AI for similar use cases. I could only look into two of these teams. In both cases, the issue wasn’t with AI, but with product.

Many people have told me that the technical aspects of their AI applications are straightforward. The hard part is user experience (UX). What should the product interface look like? How to seamlessly integrate the product into the user workflow? How to incorporate human-in-the-loop?

UX has always been challenging, but it’s even more so with generative AI. While we know that generative AI is changing how we read, write, learn, teach, work, entertain, etc., we don’t quite know how yet. What will the future of reading/learning/working be like?
