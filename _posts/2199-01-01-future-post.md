# A comprehensive framework for evaluation and assessment of RAG Systems

## 1. Understanding RAG Assessment

### 1.1 What makes RAG evaluation fundamentally different from traditional LLM evaluation?

### 1.2 What are the core components that need to be evaluated in a RAG system?

### 1.3 Why do traditional evaluation metrics fall short for RAG systems?

### 1.4 What are the fundamental tradeoffs in RAG evaluation?

## 2. Retrieval Quality Assessment
	
### 2.1	How do we measure the effectiveness of the retrieval component?
### 2.2	What metrics best capture semantic relevance versus lexical matching?
### 2.3	How can we evaluate retrieval robustness across different query types?
### 2.4	What are the key considerations in evaluating chunk size and context window optimization?

## 3.	Knowledge Integration Evaluation
### 3.1	How do we measure the system's ability to incorporate retrieved knowledge?
### 3.2	What methods can detect and quantify hallucinations?
### 3.3	How can we evaluate multi-hop reasoning capabilities?
### 3.4	What metrics best capture source attribution accuracy?
